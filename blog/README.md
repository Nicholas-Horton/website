# About Me

I am a Senior Software Developer working for Teldio. I fell in love with
software development making game modifications as a kid when I was floored I
could change and entire game world just by editing some weird looking text
files. A few decades later, here I am still at it!

I have 6+ years of development experience with a variety of technology stacks.
I've worked on mission-critical, life-preserving applications where system
stability and accuracy is critical.

I am most comfortable working in TypeScript and Go but I'm always looking
to try new languages to keep on top of what tools are available and what
languages are best suited to solving which problems.

I write my thoughts here about what I'm working on and what tools I like to
use. Let me know what you think!
