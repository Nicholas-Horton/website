# About Me

I am a Senior Software Developer working for Teldio. I fell in love with
softeware development making game modifications as a kid when I was floored I
could change and entire game world just by editing some weird looking text
files. A few decades later, here I am still at it!

I write my thoughts here about what I'm working on and what tools I like to
use. Let me know what you think!
